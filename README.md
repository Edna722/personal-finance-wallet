# personal-finance-wallet
Welcome to my Personal Finance Wallet project! This is a tool I am building to help individuals budget and track their personal expenses, enabling smarter financial decisions and better money management.

## Project Overview
The Personal Finance Wallet will be designed to help users manage their personal finances by allowing them to input and categorize their expenses, set budgets for various categories, and track their spending over time. The goal is to make budgeting easier and more transparent by giving users real-time insights into their financial health.

* This project was created as a personal initiative to manage my own finances more effectively, and I wanted to share it with others who may find it helpful.

## Features
* Expense Tracking: Log and categorize daily expenses (e.g., food, transportation, entertainment, utilities, etc.).
* Budgeting: Set budget limits for each category and track progress towards staying within your budget.
* Monthly Overview: View a summary of monthly spending, comparing actual expenses against the set budget.
* Visualizations: Interactive charts and graphs that provide a clear view of your spending patterns and financial health.
* Transaction History: Review a detailed list of past transactions and adjust as necessary.

## Technologies to be Used
Frontend:
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for building the user interface)
* Bootstrap (for responsive design)
* Backend:
Python (Flask/Django for backend development)
* SQLite (for storing expenses and budgeting data)
Additional Libraries:
* Chart.js (for visualizing data through graphs and charts)
* Pandas (for data manipulation)
